I have been given a dataset which contains data from different Airlines. I have gathered the requirement from the client on the analysis that has to be performed using the dataset. The analysis is for different airports from which the airlines depart and arrive. The average delay time of an airline over a period of time and more.

Two dashboards are created :

Flight status (on time, delayed, cancelled) month wise and airline wise. Also I have a look at average delay time for that duration.
Air traffic analysis is to be performed which gives insights as when is the best time to book a flight and what is the peak hour when the maximum flights are available.
Publish the report to web and pin the tiles to a dashboard and give the different users in the client side accesses. Make sure to refresh data on a daily basis in the dashboard.
